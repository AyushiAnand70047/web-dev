git --version

if i want to track the changes in any folder:
git init (now git will track this folder, one hidden folder .git will be created where changes will be added)
git add <filename> (to track individual file inside the folder)
git add . (all file will be tracked which is inside this folder)
git status (show tracked and untracked file)
git commit -m "<commit message>"
git log (to see the history)
git diff (to see the changes in folder after commit)

To revert back:
