git -> version control system

git --version

if i want to track the changes in any folder:
git init (now git will track this folder, one hidden folder .git will be created where changes will be added)
git add <filename> (to track individual file inside the folder)
git add . (all file will be tracked which is inside this folder)
git status (show tracked and untracked file)
git commit -m "<commit message>"
git log (to see the history)
git diff (to see the changes in folder after commit)

To revert back:
git log --oneline
git reset <commit hash> (it uncommit the changes after particular hash but changes will not be deleted from the folder)
git reset --hard <commit hash> (discard all the changes after particular hash)

to see the difference between two commit(copy git commit hash)
git diff <commit hash 1> <commit hash 2>
press q (to exit)

Github:
create repository on Github
git remote add origin https://github.com/AyushiAnand70047/web-dev.git (now we can push or pull changes in this repository from terminal)
git push -u origin main (push in main branch)

if main branch does not exist:
git branch (it will show existing branch)
git checkout -b main (it will create main branch)
