HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
-> Protocol(set of rules) used to transfer Htext(Hyper link text -> web docs)

All the data which is transferred from HTTP is human readable:
-> Network tab visibility
-> Inspect element
-> Page source

Http is stateless protocol:
Everytime you visit a page, you are a new user.(No memory for the previous user.)

Session -> stored state between frontend and backend

Cookie(Information)

HTTP Headers(The information which we have to send to browser)
information like
-> client
-> Browser Info
-> Date Time
-> Cookie to store

Request Response Model:
Browser send request to server, server give some response

Type of request(Get, Post, Delete,...)

Response Code(200, 404, 500,...)

-> What action to perform(Get, Post)
-> Where to perform(http://api.hitesh.ai/auth)
-> Was it done(200,404,...)

HTTP/2(Http version 2)
-> http1 is backup for http2 and still it is used
-> uses compression(server send data in compressed format like zip)
-> uses multiplexing(Many files at same time)
-> uses encryption(https -> secure communication layer between browser and server)
    In AWS, we don't use https for internal communication
    As in computer every calculation is having some computaion cost.

User Agent(agent which send user request to server like browser)
TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)
FTP(File Transfer Protocol)
IP(Internet Protocol)
URL(Uniform Resource Locator)
DNS(Domain Name System) -> points url to IP
Header(pass additional information)
Payload(Actual data - email, password)
Cache(store the data)

Summary:
Browser <---> Server
-> setup TCP connection
-> exchange TLS certificate
-> send request(like get, post) + URL + Data + more
-> Get the response back
   with status code & data(like img, csv, text)
-> TCP connection is closed(state less)
