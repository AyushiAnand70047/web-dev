Open command prompt:
docker -v (To check docker version)

docker run -it ubuntu (run container in which we want ubuntu image)
  Now we are inside ubuntu container 
  if any image is already downloaded, this command will reuse that image and create new container. 
  if it is not installed, then it install it from hub.docker.com
