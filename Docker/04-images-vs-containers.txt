Containers run images, cointainers are isolated with each other.

We can create Custom Image:
like image having Ubuntu, Node, Mongodb
we can publish out custom image on docker hub, suppose with name ubuntu-with-tools then anyone can run this on their local container.
And similarly I can deploy this image on any cloud using container

Some command:
docker container ls (run this command in terminal)
ls is used here for listing all the running container

docker container ls -a (list all container)

docker start <name of container> (to start any container)
docker stop <name of container> (to end any container)

docker exec <container name> ls  (ls result is executed and container is disconnected)

docker exec -it <container name> bash(if we want terminal to get attached with that container)

ctrl + d (to exit)

docker images (to see the images)
or
docker image ls

To create container with other image:
docker run -it node (suppose node image)
