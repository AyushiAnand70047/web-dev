If multiple container is there, we need to run it individually.

In real world, we have multiple container and each having its own port mapping.
line by line execution of each container is not a good way.

So, we can setup muliple container and run it.
Create file:
docker-compose.yml
(inside this we can give our configuration to run multiple container)
docker compose up (run services)

docker compose down (will remove everything)

docker compose up -d (detached mode, means run in background)
